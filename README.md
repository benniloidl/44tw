> "4-for-the-win": A WebSocket-based 1vs1 game where a player must place 4 pieces in a row or diagonal to win

## Getting Started

First, install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then you can run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You might need to open [http://localhost:3000/api/ws](http://localhost:3000/api/ws) to verify the WebSocket server is running.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
